# rtc-quickconnect

This is a high level helper module designed to help you get up
an running with WebRTC really, really quickly.  By using this module you
are trading off some flexibility, so if you need a more flexible
configuration you should drill down into lower level components of the
[rtc.io](http://www.rtc.io) suite.  In particular you should check out
[rtc](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc).

## Upgrading to 1.0

The [upgrading to 1.0 documentation](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-quickconnect/blob/master/docs/upgrading-to-1.0.md)
provides some information on what you need to change to upgrade to
`rtc-quickconnect@1.0`.  Additionally, the
[quickconnect demo app](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtcio-demo-quickconnect)
has been updated which should provide some additional information.

## Example Usage

In the simplest case you simply call quickconnect with a single string
argument which tells quickconnect which server to use for signaling:

```js
var quickconnect = require('rtc-quickconnect');

quickconnect('http://rtc.io/switchboard/', { room: 'qc-simple-demo' })
  .on('call:started', function(id, pc, data) {
    console.log('we have a new connection to: ' + id);
  });
```

## Events

The following events are emitted from the signalling object created by
calling `quickconnect()`:

### Call Level Events

A "call" in quickconnect is equivalent to an established `RTCPeerConnection`
between this quickconnect instance a remote peer.

- `call:started => function(id, peerconnection, data)`

  Triggered once a peer connection has been established been established
  between this quickconnect instance and another.

- `call:ended => function(id)`

  Triggered when a peer connection has been closed.  This may be due to the
  peer connection itself indicating that it has been closed, or we may have
  lost connection with the remote signaller and the connection has timed out.

### Data Channel Level Events

- `channel:opened => function(id, datachannel, data)`

  The `channel:opened` event is triggered whenever an `RTCDataChannel` has
  been opened (it's ready to send data) to a remote peer.

- `channel:opened:%label% => function(id, datachannel, data)`

  This is equivalent of the `channel:opened` event, but only triggered for
  a channel with label `%label%`.  For example:

  ```js
  quickconnect('http://rtc.io/switchboard', { room: 'test' })
    .createDataChannel('foo')
    .createDataChannel('bar')
    .on('channel:opened:foo', function(id, dc) {
      console.log('channel foo opened for peer: ' + id);
    });
  ```

  In the case above the console message would only be displayed for the
  `foo` channel once open, and when the `bar` channel is opened no handler
  would be invoked.

- `channel:closed => function(id, label)`

  Emitted when the channel has been closed, works when a connection has
  been closed or the channel itself has been closed.

- `channel:closed:%label% => function(id, label)`

  The label specific equivalent of `channel:closed`.

### Stream Level Events

- `stream:added => function(id, stream, data)`

  The `stream:added` event is triggered when an `RTCPeerConnection` has
  successfully been established to another peer that contains remote
  streams.  Additionally, if you are using quickconnect in it's "reactive"
  mode then you will also receive `stream:added` events as streams are
  dynamically added to the connection by the remote peer.

- `stream:removed => function(id)`

  As per the `stream:added` event but triggered when a stream has been
  removed.

## Example Usage (using data channels)

When working with WebRTC data channels, you can call the `createDataChannel`
function helper that is attached to the object returned from the
`quickconnect` call.  The `createDataChannel` function signature matches
the signature of the `RTCPeerConnection` `createDataChannel` function.

At the minimum it requires a label for the channel, but you can also pass
through a dictionary of options that can be used to fine tune the
data channel behaviour.  For more information on these options, I'd
recommend having a quick look at the WebRTC spec:

http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/webrtc.html#dictionary-rtcdatachannelinit-members

If in doubt, I'd recommend not passing through options.

```js
var freeice = require('freeice');
var quickconnect = require('rtc-quickconnect');
var opts = {
  room: 'qcexample-dctest',
  // debug: true,
  iceServers: freeice()
};

quickconnect('http://rtc.io/switchboard/', opts)
  // tell quickconnect we want a datachannel called test
  .createDataChannel('test')
  // when the test channel is open, let us know
  .on('channel:opened:test', function(id, dc) {
    dc.onmessage = function(evt) {
      console.log('peer ' + id + ' says: ' + evt.data);
    };

    console.log('test dc open for peer: ' + id);
    dc.send('hi');
  });
```

__NOTE:__ Data channel interoperability has been tested between Chrome 32
and Firefox 26, which both make use of SCTP data channels.

__NOTE:__ The current stable version of Chrome is 31, so interoperability
with Firefox right now will be hard to achieve.

## Example Usage (using captured media)

Another example is displayed below, and this example demonstrates how
to use `rtc-quickconnect` to create a simple video conferencing application:

```js
var quickconnect = require('rtc-quickconnect');
var media = require('rtc-media');
var crel = require('crel');

// create containers for our local and remote video
var local = crel('div', { class: 'local' });
var remote = crel('div', { class: 'remote' });
var media  
var peerMedia = {};

// capture local media
var localMedia = media();

// require('cog/logger').enable('*');

// once media is captured, connect
localMedia.once('capture', function(stream) {
  quickconnect('http://rtc.io/switchboard/', { room: 'conftest' })
    // broadcast our captured media to other participants in the room
    .addStream(stream)
    // when a peer is connected (and active) pass it to us for use
    .on('call:started', function(id, pc, data) {
      console.log('peer connected: ', id);

      // render the remote streams
      pc.getRemoteStreams().forEach(renderRemote(id));
    })
    // when a peer leaves, remove teh media
    .on('call:ended', function(id) {
      // remove media for the target peer from the dom
      (peerMedia[id] || []).splice(0).forEach(function(el) {
        el.parentNode.removeChild(el);
      });
    })
});

// render the local media
localMedia.render(local);

// render a remote video
function renderRemote(id) {
  // create the peer media list
  peerMedia[id] = peerMedia[id] || [];

  return function(stream) {
    peerMedia[id] = peerMedia[id].concat(media(stream).render(remote));
  }
}

/* extra code to handle dynamic html and css creation */

// add some basic styling
document.head.appendChild(crel('style', [
  '.local { position: absolute;  right: 10px; }',
  '.local video { max-width: 200px; }'
].join('\n')));

// add the local and remote elements
document.body.appendChild(local);
document.body.appendChild(remote);
```

## Regarding Signalling and a Signalling Server

Signaling is an important part of setting up a WebRTC connection and for
our examples we use our own test instance of the
[rtc-switchboard](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-switchboard). For your
testing and development you are more than welcome to use this also, but
just be aware that we use this for our testing so it may go up and down
a little.  If you need something more stable, why not consider deploying
an instance of the switchboard yourself - it's pretty easy :)

```

### Valid Quick Connect Options

The options provided to the `rtc-quickconnect` module function influence the
behaviour of some of the underlying components used from the rtc.io suite.

Listed below are some of the commonly used options:

- `ns` (default: '')

  An optional namespace for your signalling room.  While quickconnect
  will generate a unique hash for the room, this can be made to be more
  unique by providing a namespace.  Using a namespace means two demos
  that have generated the same hash but use a different namespace will be
  in different rooms.

- `room` (default: null) _added 0.6_

  Rather than use the internal hash generation
  (plus optional namespace) for room name generation, simply use this room
  name instead.  __NOTE:__ Use of the `room` option takes precendence over
  `ns`.

- `debug` (default: false)

Write rtc.io suite debug output to the browser console.

#### Options for Peer Connection Creation

Options that are passed onto the
[rtc.createConnection](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc#createconnectionopts-constraints)
function:

- `iceServers`

This provides a list of ice servers that can be used to help negotiate a
connection between peers.

#### Options for P2P negotiation

Under the hood, quickconnect uses the
[rtc/couple](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc#rtccouple) logic, and the options
passed to quickconnect are also passed onto this function.

### Quickconnect Broadcast and Data Channel Helper Functions

The following are functions that are patched into the `rtc-signaller`
instance that make working with and creating functional WebRTC applications
a lot simpler.

#### addStream

```
addStream(stream:MediaStream) => qc
```

Add the stream to active calls and also save the stream so that it
can be added to future calls.

#### close()

The `close` function provides a convenient way of closing all associated
peer connections.

#### createDataChannel(label, config)

Request that a data channel with the specified `label` is created on
the peer connection.  When the data channel is open and available, an
event will be triggered using the label of the data channel.

For example, if a new data channel was requested using the following
call:

```js
var qc = quickconnect('http://rtc.io/switchboard').createDataChannel('test');
```

Then when the data channel is ready for use, a `test:open` event would
be emitted by `qc`.

#### reactive()

Flag that this session will be a reactive connection.

#### removeStream

```
removeStream(stream:MediaStream)
```

Remove the specified stream from both the local streams that are to 
be connected to new peers, and also from any active calls.

#### requestChannel

```
requestChannel(targetId, label, callback)
```

This is a function that can be used to respond to remote peers supplying
a data channel as part of their configuration.  As per the `receiveStream`
function this function will either fire the callback immediately if the
channel is already available, or once the channel has been discovered on
the call.

#### requestStream

```
requestStream(targetId, idx, callback)
```

Used to request a remote stream from a quickconnect instance. If the
stream is already available in the calls remote streams, then the callback
will be triggered immediately, otherwise this function will monitor
`stream:added` events and wait for a match.

In the case that an unknown target is requested, then an exception will
be thrown.

#### profile(data)

Update the profile data with the attached information, so when 
the signaller announces it includes this data in addition to any
room and id information.

#### waitForCall

```
waitForCall(targetId, callback)
```

Wait for a call from the specified targetId.  If the call is already
active the callback will be fired immediately, otherwise we will wait
for a `call:started` event that matches the requested `targetId`
