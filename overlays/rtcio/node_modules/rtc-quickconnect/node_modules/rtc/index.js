  # rtc

  The `rtc` module does most of the heavy lifting within the
  [rtc.io](http://rtc.io) suite.  Primarily it handles the logic of coupling
  a local `RTCPeerConnection` with it's remote counterpart via an
  [rtc-signaller](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-signaller) signalling
  channel.

  ## Getting Started

  If you decide that the `rtc` module is a better fit for you than either
  [rtc-quickconnect](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-quickconnect) or
  [rtc-glue](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-glue) then the code snippet below
  will provide you a guide on how to get started using it in conjunction with
  the [rtc-signaller](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-signaller) and
  [rtc-media](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-media) modules:

  <<< examples/getting-started.js

  This code definitely doesn't cover all the cases that you need to consider
  (i.e. peers leaving, etc) but it should demonstrate how to:

  1. Capture video and add it to a peer connection
  2. Couple a local peer connection with a remote peer connection
  3. Deal with the remote steam being discovered and how to render
     that to the local interface.

var gen = require('./generators');

// export detect
var detect = exports.detect = require('./detect');

// export cog logger for convenience

// export peer connection

// add the couple utility

  ### rtc.createConnection

  ```
  createConnection(opts?, constraints?) => RTCPeerConnection
  ```

  Create a new `RTCPeerConnection` auto generating default opts as required.

  ```js
  var conn;

  // this is ok
  conn = rtc.createConnection();

  // and so is this
  conn = rtc.createConnection({
    iceServers: []
  });
  ```
**/
exports.createConnection = function(opts, constraints) {
  return new ((opts || {}).RTCPeerConnection || RTCPeerConnection)(
    // generate the config based on options provided
    gen.config(opts),

    // generate appropriate connection constraints
    gen.connectionConstraints(opts, constraints)
  );
